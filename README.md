# Frontend Challenge - Test App

This project is the frontend part of a challenge developed with the intention of testing various tools and skills, among which you can find practical handling of Node.js (developed in Node 16) as requested, as well as the use of JavaScript (ES6+), React, Webpack, and React-Bootstrap correspondingly.

## Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
To be able to run the application, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. 

### Installation
1. First, clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/CarlosAzpurua/testapp-frontend.git

# cd into the new directory
cd ./testapp-frontend

# create a `.env` file by copying contents from `.env.example`
cp .env.example .env

```

### Installation üîß

2. To start all processes, functionalities, and testing, we need some libraries that must be previously installed. For this reason, we will use the following commands to install these libraries.

```
npm i
```

or

```
npm install
```

This will install the libraries we have set up in the package.json, which are explained in more detail below.

### Launching üî®

3. Here we have the code that we must execute in the terminal for the app to start.

```
npm start
```

This will launch the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

### Build üî©

4. To build the app for production, use the following command.

```
npm run build
```
